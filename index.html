        Nature, first created in 1869, was not the first magazine of its kind in
        Britain. One journal to precede Nature was Recreative Science: A Record
        and Remembrancer of Intellectual Observation,[12] which, created in
        1859, began as a natural history magazine and progressed to include more
        physical observational science and technical subjects and less natural
        history.[13] The journal's name changed from its original title to
        Intellectual Observer: A Review of Natural History, Microscopic
        Research, and Recreative Science[14] and then to the Student and
        Intellectual Observer of Science, Literature, and Art.[15] While
        Recreative Science had attempted to include more physical sciences such
        as astronomy and archaeology, the Intellectual Observer broadened itself
        further to include literature and art as well.

    <p>
      Nature mostly publishes research articles. Spotlight articles are not
      research papers but mostly news or magazine style papers and hence do not
      count towards impact factor nor receive similar recognition as research
      articles. Some spotlight articles are also paid by partners or sponsors.
